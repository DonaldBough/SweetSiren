##Sweet Siren
Just this Christmas break I was diagnosed with type one diabetes. So with the natural "hacker spirit" I instantly began to think of what I could do to help myself and others from the potentially life treating drops in blood sugar. This app was start at the HackIllinois 2016 hackathon.

##What it does
Sweet Siren isn't just another data logger for your blood sugar information, it's much smarter than that. Sweet Siren looks for patterns in the slopes of your manually inputted blood sugar levels for signs of blood sugar drops in the future. Giving diabetics the valuable time to get your sugar up before it drops, Sweet Siren brings up a notification warning of low blood sugar in the future, along with texting the users selected "Emergency Contact List". Sweet Siren could let parents with diabetic children live more peacefully and at ease knowing they'll be made aware of when a loved one is in danger.

##Algorithm
Starting as 36 hour one man project, it currently uses a static decision tree based off of indicators of low blood sugars I've noticed from examining my own blood sugar. With some help and better research, I hope to implement machine learning to better the successful predictability of Sweet Siren.

#What's next for Sweet Siren
Adding GPS messages to accompany the text messages would be an extra layer of protection from sugar drops. The analytical algorithm has plenty of room for improvement considering this is my first after all.
